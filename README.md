# 🖥️⚙️ Computer Vision Engineering program for the detection of the edges of an image by Sobel operators
The program waits for an image represented in memory (width, height, RGB pixels) and returns a binary card (0/255) indicating the edges. The code includes: grayscale conversion, convolution, gradient calculation, normalization and threshold. A sample of use and a minimal dune file are provided.

## To use it with others format

The module above does not make an image IO. To use it with PNG/JPEG files you can:

> Use the ocaml-images library (package images) or ocaml-magick to load/save, then convert the pixels to the format expected by the module.

> Or write a small adapter that reads via Stb_image bindings or other.

## An exemple of use 

```
open Printf

let () =
  (* simple synthetic test: 100x100, black with white square in center *)
  let w = 100 and h = 100 in
  let img = Edge.make_image w h (fun x y ->
    if x >= 30 && x < 70 && y >= 30 && y < 70 then (255,255,255) else (0,0,0)
  ) in
  let edges = Edge.detect_edges img ~threshold:40 in
  (* print a tiny ASCII preview *)
  for y = 0 to h-1 do
    for x = 0 to w-1 do
      let v = edges.(y*w + x) in
      printf "%c" (if v = 255 then '#' else ' ')
    done;
    printf "\n"
  done
```
